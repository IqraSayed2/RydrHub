            You need a valid driver's license held for at least 1 year, a credit
            card in your name, and a form of identification (e.g., passport or
            national ID). International customers may need an International
            Driving Permit.

          What is the minimum age requirement?
          <i class="fas fa-chevron-down faq-arrow"></i>
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer-content">
          <p>
            The minimum age to rent a car is typically 21 years old. Drivers
            under 25 may incur a young driver surcharge, which varies by
            location and vehicle type.

          Is insurance included in the rental price?

        <div class="faq-answer-content">
          <p>
            Basic third-party liability insurance is usually included. However,
            we recommend reviewing our optional coverage plans for full
            protection against damage, theft, and personal accident.

        What happens if I return the car late?

      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer-content">
        <p>
          Returning the car late may result in additional charges, often

          immediately if you anticipate a late return.

          We operate on a "full to full" fuel policy. This means you receive the

          Otherwise, a refueling service charge will apply.
